## Task

### Detect Pangram


Explanation here

A pangram is a sentence that contains every single letter of the alphabet at least once. For example, the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is a pangram, because it uses the letters A-Z at least once (case is irrelevant).

Given a string, detect whether or not it is a pangram. Return True if it is, False if not. Ignore numbers and punctuation.


## Test Examples

```js

const chai = require("chai");
const assert = chai.assert;
chai.config.truncateThreshold=0;

describe("Tests", () => {
  it("test1", () => {
    var string = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
    assert.strictEqual(isPangram(string), true)
  })
  it("test2", () => {
    var string = "This is not a pangram."
    assert.strictEqual(isPangram(string), false)
  });
});


```
