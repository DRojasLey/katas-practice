# 47th Kata -- Anagram Groups


by *[NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/problems/anagram-groups)*


## Task

### Anagram Groups


Given an array of strings strs, group all anagrams together into sublists. You may return the output in any order.

An anagram is a string that contains the exact same characters as another string, but the order of the characters can be different.

Example 1:
```
Input: strs = ["act","pots","tops","cat","stop","hat"]

Output: [["hat"],["act", "cat"],["stop", "pots", "tops"]]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: strs = ["x"]

Output: [["x"]]
```
Example 3:
```
Input: strs = [""]

Output: [[""]]
```
Constraints:

 * ```1 <= strs.length <= 1000.```
 * ```0 <= strs[i].length <= 100```
 * ```strs[i]``` is made up of lowercase English letters.


## Test Examples

```js

["act","pots","tops","cat","stop","hat"]

## Notes about the interesting one:

this one took me a while to really understand, the actual kata I was not able to solve by myself
Normally I can brute force it but not even reading a solution was I able to implement a solution.
